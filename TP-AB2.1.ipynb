    "A **modificação** consiste em enviar informações sobre a carga do sistema (_system workload_) em vez de informações sobre falhas que indicariam os processos suspeitos e não-suspeitos. Para isso, em vez de cada processo enviar mensagem do tipo `I'm p and I'm alive`, os processos enviarão a medição interna da sua carga de trabalho. \n",
    "\n",
    "Para simular a medição da carga de trabalho dos processos, utilize números aleatórios entre `0` e `1` com precisão de uma casa decimal apenas, por exemplo, `0.4`.\n",

    "### Detalhes de implementação\n",
    "\n",
    "Cada processo do sistema deverá ser implementado como um Julia Worker. O Master será apenas o gestor do experimento, ou seja, será responsável para criar os processos (Julia Workers) e iniciar o sistema. Uma vez iniciado, o sistema deve funcionar por si sem depender do Master; uma vez que o algoritmo é descentralizado.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para fins de visualização do monitoramento da carga de trabalho, os **Workers devem enviar ao Master** periodicamente (a cada `2` segundos) uma mensagem com o estado dos workers que eles monitoram (incluindo ele mesmo). Essa mensagem deve ser impresso na tela do master da seguinte forma.\n",

    "remotecall\n",
    "@fetchfrom\n",
    "@everywhere\n",
    "sleep\n",
    "@spawn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Para buscar uma rápida ajuda sobre as funções, utilize `?` na frente da função (ver exemplo abaixo). \n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "?addprocs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilize o [material do mini-curso do Professor](https://github.com/proflage/2018-julia-hands-on) para estudo e a [documentação oficial da linguagem Julia (1.0)](https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/) para demais dúvidas.\n",
